# Hi! I am Jantinn Erezo :wave:

~ Full Stack Web Developer

I’ve been doing web development stuff for over 3+ years now, that includes full time and freelance work. I am also contributing to open source built a little package for Laravel powered apps. My main language is Php for writing backend and API stuff, HTML, CSS and Javascript to consume backend and API powering a skeleton front end. Since I am a PHP developer I heavily used Laravel Framework for building real world and robust web applications and it became my main main development platform now combined with Alpine.js for a little sprinkle of DOM reactivity, Vue.js for building complex user interfaces and last but not the least Tailwind CSS for incredibly lightweight and fast low-level styling.

I am also a minimalist and clean coder myself when it comes to web development stuff, I like doing it as minimal and performant as possible depending on how large the project is without compromising maintainability and scalability. I strictly follow software development rules and best practices as possible, you know we can’t afford too much technical debt in the future because it’s prone to frustrations and unproductivity at work that will result in poorly written low-quality web applications.
